Please Note:

This code is written under 72 hours during #LD31. It is incredibly sloppy, faulty, and all together ugly. So please do not take it serious as there are plenty of principles I wouldn't recommend using in this implementation.

Description
====

You play as a chef of a mighty restaurant and you have to serve your customers! 

At the start of the day the dishes of the day will be shown. Here you have to memorise what ingredient each dish contains and know it by heart!

During the day, your customers will first alert you of what they want to eat. You then have to prepare their dish as fast as possible and deliver it to them one by one. Afterwards they will alert you when they want to pay.

If you slack off or deliver the wrong dish, your customers will start criticising you and too many disappointed customers will leave you bankrupt!

How many days will you last?
